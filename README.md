#Project Name : Smart water dispenser for birds


Introduction:
Welcome to the Smart Water Dispenser for Birds project repository! This project introduces an innovative approach to bird feeding by integrating technology for an efficient and environmentally friendly solution.

Importance of the Project:
Traditional water dispensers often suffer from inefficiencies and resource wastage. Also the availability of water during summer season for birds can be met with this project. The Smart Water Dispenser addresses these issues by automating this process and ensuring birds have continuous access to clean water. It promotes environmental conservation while incorporating technological advancements.

Project Overview:
The Smart Bird Feeder utilizes Arduino technology along with ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor, and a buzzer. The sensors are attached to the top of two water tanks.

Full Working Details:
- Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure water levels in two tanks by emitting ultrasonic waves and calculating the time taken for them to bounce back.
- Servo Motor: Controls water flow from the main tank to the secondary tank. Activates when the water level in the secondary tank is low.(here,below 50 cm)
- Buzzer: Alerts when the water level in the main tank is critically low.(here,Below 200 cm)

Conditions and Working:
1. Water Level Monitoring: The buzzer alerts when the water level in the main tank drops below 200 cm.
2. Water Refilling: The servo motor opens to refill the secondary tank when the water level drops below 50 cm.
3. Low-Maintenance Operation: The system operates without the need for external batteries, ensuring reliable and continuous operation.

Conclusion:
The Smart Bird Feeder project merges technology with nature conservation, providing a sustainable solution for bird feeding. It ensures birds always have access to water especially during Summer Season.
